# Wasted Loot

A Synthesis patcher to automatically remove placed loot in the world for a more challenging experience.

I've done a lot of work to ensure that important quest-related items are skipped automatically. The default settings also ignore some cells/areas that make sense from a lore perspective, such as the Institute. Anything that isn't removed by the patcher is set to not respawn, so once looted it will be gone forever.

By default the patcher will skip weapons, ammo, and armor placed in the world. Even if you choose to remove these items, placed legendary items will never be removed.
